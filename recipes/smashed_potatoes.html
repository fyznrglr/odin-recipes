<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Extra crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside! These buttery smashed potatoes will make you experience softness and crispiness with every bite. This recipe makes twelve, but I cannot guarantee that will be enough! </p>
<p>Let's start with the ingredients.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>700g / 1.4lb small potatoes (12 - 14)
        <br> or
        <br>1 - 1.2kg / 2 - 2.4lb medium potatoes (6 - 8)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp salt, for boiling</li>
    <li>30g / 2tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp salt, for sprinkling</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>finely chopped parsley, optional garnish</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook potatoes: Bring a pot of water to the boil, add 1 tbsp salt. Cook potatoes until soft - small ones should take around 20 to 25 minutes, medium ones might take 30 minutes. It's ok if the skin splits. Alternatively, steam or microwave them.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan).</li>
    <li>Steam dry: Drain the potatoes and let them dry in the colander for 5 minutes or so.</li>
    <li>Smash! Place on the tray then use a large fork or potato masher to squish them, keeping them in one piece. Thin = crisper. Thicker = fluffier insides. (Both good!) More nubbly surface = better crunch!</li>
    <li>Steam dry again: Leave on the tray to steam dry for 5 minutes or so - makes them crispier!</li>
    <li>Drizzle: Drizzle with butter, then olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Bake: Bake for 45 minutes (small potatoes) to 55 minutes (medium) or until deep golden and crispy. Do not flip!</li>
    <li>Serve hot, sprinkled with parsley if desired.</li>
</ol>
