These pistachio chocolate bars are just as easy to make as they are a sight to behold! With just a few ingredients, you will have a rich chocolate bar in no time! Here are the ingredients.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup pistachio paste / butter</li>
    <li>1 to 1/2 cup shredded phyllo or kataifi, cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    <li>2 to 3 cups milk chocolate, melted</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white chocolate, melted</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan to 350Â°F.</li>
    <li>Add the shredded phyllo in and fry until golden and crispy. If frying another batch, use a slotted spoon to take out the fried phyllo. Transfer to a plate with a paper towel to drain excess oil.</li>
    <li>If you are not frying another batch, it'll be easier to set up a bowl with a strainer and pour the pan over to let the oil drain and the strainer catch the phyllo.</li>
    <li>Allow the fried phyllo to cool down for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the pistachio paste to a mixing bowl along with the fried phyllo and mix together to combine.</li>
    <li>OPTIONAL: To the chocolate mold, add a light drizzle of white chocolate.</li>
    <li>Then add in about 1/4 cup or more of melted milk chocolate and shake it around to cover the bottom and sides completely.</li>
    <li>Pop in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until hard.</li>
    <li>Take the mold out and fill the chocolate mold with the pistachio and phyllo mixture almost all the way to the top.</li>  
    <li>Cover the filling entirely with more melted chocolate and pop it back in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until hard.</li>
    <li>Once set, pop out of the mold and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
